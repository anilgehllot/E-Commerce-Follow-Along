Milestone 1: Project Overview
Authentication: login logout signup
Product page: Displays all the products

Payment gateway
Milestone 2: Backend and Frontend
I created a folder called frontend within which we first created a react file and also installed dependencies and connected the tailwindcss using postCSS. On this folder I created two more folders:

Authorization
Signup
The Authorization folder contains two more folders which are Login and Signup. As part of milestone 2 I was asked to complete the login page which I have completed.

I created a folder called backend which just contains the node modules and I installed express, mongoose, nodemon and cors. 4

Milestone 3: Server and Database
Today I set up a database and a server by using Express and Mongodb-Atlas. I also configured the server to listen on a designated port.
I also created a error handling folder for better debugging.
Milestone 4:
I created a User Model: This is like a blueprint for how your users' data will be stored in the database
I created a User Controlleras well: This will help you manage what happens with your user data (like adding a new user or getting their information).
I also enabled and configured Multer: Multer will allows my app to accept and store files (such as images) uploaded by users.
Milestone 5:
I created a signup page and linked the sign up page to the login page so that it is easy to traverse.
Milestone 6:
I used to JWT token to create an activation for users. This holds basic user information.
Also learnt how to send a URL with the token via email.
I also used nodemailer to send verification emails and created an endpoint to verify the user.
Milestone 7:
I learned to use bcrypt to encrypt the users password and saved the hashed password in the database instead of plain text.
Created a endoint which fetches user data from database on provided emial/username
Validated password by comparing the userâ€™s entered password with the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt. If they match, proceed with authentication; otherwise, an error is sent.
